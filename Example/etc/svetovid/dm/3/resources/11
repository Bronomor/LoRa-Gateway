0=No error 1=Low battery power 2=External power supply off 3=GPS
 * module failure 4=Low received signal strength 5=Out of memory 6=SMS
 * failure 7=IP connectivity failure 8=Peripheral malfunction
 * 9..15=Reserved for future use 16..32=Device specific error codes  When
 * the single Device Object Instance is initiated, there is only one
 * error code Resource Instance whose value is equal to 0 that means no
 * error. When the first error happens, the LwM2M Client changes error
 * code Resource Instance to any non-zero value to indicate the error
 * type. When any other error happens, a new error code Resource Instance
 * is created. When an error associated with a Resource Instance is no
 * longer present, that Resource Instance is deleted. When the single
 * existing error is no longer present, the LwM2M Client returns to the
 * original no error state where Instance 0 has value 0. This error code
 * Resource MAY be observed by the LwM2M Server. How to deal with LwM2M
 * Clientâ€™s error report depends on the policy of the LwM2M Server. Error
 * codes in between 16 and 32 are specific to the Device and may have
 * different meanings among implementations.'''
